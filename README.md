## Introduction
As we utilize applications, services, and gadgets to access a variety of experiences, our digital and physical lives are becoming increasingly linked. This digital change allows us to interact in previously inconceivable ways with hundreds of businesses and thousands of other people. However, identity information has been exposed much too frequently as a result of security breaches. These violations affect our personal, professional, and financial life. Pseudo Pass believes there is a better way. Every person has the right to an identity that they own and manage, one that securely stores aspects of their digital identity while respecting their privacy. This introduction explains how we're working with a diverse community to develop an open, trustworthy, interoperable, and standards-based Decentralized Identity (DID) solution for individuals and enterprises.

## Project Overview
The Pseudo Pass project aims to develop a Decentralized Identity (DID) solution that securely stores aspects of a person's digital identity while respecting their privacy. It allows individuals and enterprises to have control over their identity information and ensures the verification of identities through the use of verifiable credentials. The project focuses on building a robust and user-friendly system that promotes self-sovereign identity and protects users from security breaches.

### 1.1 Project Goals and Objectives
- Develop an open, trustworthy, interoperable, and standards-based Decentralized Identity (DID) solution.
- Provide individuals and enterprises with control over their digital identity.
- Securely store and manage digital identities while respecting privacy.
- Enable verification of identities through the use of verifiable credentials.
- Protect users' personal, professional, and financial information from security breaches.

### 1.2 Problem and Motivation
Identity information has been exposed too frequently due to security breaches, resulting in significant consequences for individuals and organizations. Centralized identity management systems have proven vulnerable to cyber attacks and privacy violations. Pseudo Pass aims to address these issues by providing a decentralized, self-sovereign identity solution that empowers users to control their digital identities and minimizes the risk of exposure.

### 1.3 Project Application and Impact
Pseudo Pass will have a wide range of applications in various industries, including finance, healthcare, education, and more. The project will enable individuals and enterprises to securely manage their digital identities and provide verifiable credentials when necessary. By promoting self-sovereign identity and privacy, Pseudo Pass aims to have a positive impact on personal, professional, and financial security.

### 1.4 Project Results and Deliverables
The expected results from this project include:
- Development of a program capable of creating Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) from physical IDs (e.g., school ID) and verifying those DIDs using verifiable credentials (VC).
- Implementation of a system that securely stores and manages digital identities.
- Creation of a prototype that demonstrates the envisioned functionality within four months.
- Regular progress reports documenting the project's advancements.
- Start of the coding phase within two months.

## Background and Related Work
### 2.1 Background and Technologies
Pseudo Pass is based on the latest W3C standard for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs provide a verified and trustworthy identity solution while avoiding the collection of unnecessary personal information. The project utilizes technologies such as React, JavaScript, Firebase, Dock.io API, Node.js, and MongoDB to build the frontend, backend, and database components of the system. These technologies enable the implementation of DIDs and verifiable credentials in a secure and efficient manner.

### 2.2 State-of-the-art
Research in the field of decentralized identity has explored various applications and use cases. For example, the concept of vehicle-to-vehicle energy trading using DIDs has been proposed as a decentralized and secure approach to energy trading [1]. Additionally, the use of DIDs and verifiable credentials has been suggested to address the issue of counterfeit phones by decentralizing the IMEI database [2]. These examples demonstrate the potential impact of decentralized identity solutions in different domains.

## System Design
### 3.1 Architecture Design
The Pseudo Pass system is designed using a scalable and modular architecture. It leverages HTML, CSS, TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, J2EE, REST API, React, Dojo, and other technologies to provide a robust and user-friendly experience. Development tools such as Bitbucket/Git, Jenkins, JUnit, UML, and JIRA are utilized to facilitate the development process. Eclipse is the recommended development environment for the project.

### 3.2 Design Constraints, Problems, Trade-offs, and Solutions
The design of the Pseudo Pass system considers various constraints, problems, trade-offs, and their respective solutions. These aspects are taken into account to ensure the security, privacy, and usability of the system. The design aims to strike a balance between functionality and user experience while mitigating potential risks and challenges.

## Installation
To install and run the Pseudo Pass project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pseudo-pass.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up the database and configure the necessary environment variables.
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Start the application: `npm start`
6. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage
Once the Pseudo Pass application is running, users can create their decentralized identities (DIDs), associate verifiable credentials, and securely manage their digital identities. The application provides a user-friendly interface for performing these actions and accessing various services without compromising privacy.
