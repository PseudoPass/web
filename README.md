# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Project Goals and Objectives

Pseudo Pass aims to provide a decentralized and self-sovereign identity solution through the use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The project's goal is to empower individuals to securely manage their digital identities while respecting their privacy.

## 1.2 Problem and Motivation

The project addresses the frequent exposure of identity information due to security breaches, which negatively impacts personal, professional, and financial lives. Pseudo Pass believes in a better way of managing identities, where individuals have ownership and control over their digital identities. By minimizing the collection of unnecessary personal information, Pseudo Pass preserves privacy and protects against malicious actors.

## 1.3 Project Application and Impact

Pseudo Pass aims to develop an open, trustworthy, interoperable, and standards-based Decentralized Identity (DID) solution for individuals and enterprises. The project's application spans various domains, including authentication, secure access to websites, digital transactions, and identity verification. By providing a trust-free system and self-sovereign identity control, Pseudo Pass has the potential to revolutionize identity management and enhance privacy and security in the digital world.

## 1.4 Project Results and Deliverables

The expected results and deliverables of the project include the development of a program that can create DIDs from physical IDs (e.g., school ID) and verify those DIDs using VCs. The project aims to create a functional prototype within four months, along with monthly progress reports. The ability to digitally represent and validate various IDs while preserving privacy will be a significant achievement.

## 1.5 Project Report Structure

The project report follows the following structure:

- Chapter 1: Introduction
